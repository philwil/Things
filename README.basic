This is an attempt to create a method to find/describe/control things 
in an interconnected world.

A simple example is a set of gpios on a small system.

Take a url style of format

//my_new_pi/gpio_1/?value=1

This will set the value of gpio_1 on my_new_pi to 1 !

It would be nice to be able to set this up very simply.

try this 
//my_new_pi/?isa=system&ip_address=10.0.1.2&port=3456

//my_new_pi/gpio_1/?isa=gpio&pin=2&dir=output&value=1




Add to this some audio/video inputs and outputs and the Thing starts to have more interesting  personalities.

I have been working on this sort of data structure for many years now.
I also used to "NOT LIKE" C++.
But, looking at more recent releases of C++ there are some good structures that are worth looking at.

So, I am also using this to learn about C++.

Very basic code for now. Just about to start a Thing server (that runs on my_new_pi) for example.
