working on 
    ./things one

*** parsing attributes
  Basic stuff done
   we can have attributes in line

***the connection is next

***then discovery  ??

** then isa


the one concept this a single one line url to set and get things

For example 
"sysfoo/?isa=connection&ip_addr=10.0.1.23&port=23456/gpios/gpio_1/?isa=gpio&dir=output&pin=1";

Just parsing the attributes now

connection tells us how to parse the rest of the line.

In this case 

/gpios/gpio_1/?isa=gpio&dir=output&pin=1
is sent to sysfoo 


After the initial setup the following will suffice

    sysfoo/gpios/gpio_1/?value=1


isa's define how to prcess the attributes
   send to a connection
   write to gpios
etc
